# Final Project: trash sorting the right wAI

## 1 Overview:

Since sustainability and the environment are areas of interest, we chose this as a base for our project, and to focus specifically on garbage disposal. Incorrect sorting of recycling is a major problem and people often don't know how to sort their recycling. We aimed to build a model that could be fed an image of trash and classify it correctly, giving the correct recycling bin as an output. The model works using resnet18 (pre-trained model) and pytorch.

Final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
